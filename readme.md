# Introduction to R workshop. University of Hertfordshire. July 15-16, 2019

The slides for Part 1 are [here](R-workshop-part-1.pdf). All required data files are in the `data` directory, but all data frames are available as an [data Rda file](data/workshop_data.Rda).

For Part 1, the only required R package is `tidyverse` (which is a package of packages).
